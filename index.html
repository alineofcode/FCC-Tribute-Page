                <li><time datetime="1944">1944</time> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, 
                    and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different 
                    strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                <li><time datetime="1945">1945</time> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li><time datetime="1953">1953</time> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, 
                    creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li><time datetime="1962">1962</time>  - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian

                    Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. 
                    Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. 
                    Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li><time datetime="2009">2009</time> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
